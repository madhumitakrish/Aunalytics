## Problem Statement 1

In this notebook I have worked with Data Cleaning and Preprocessing. I encoded the categorical variables by introducing dummy variables. I have also scaled the numerical variables. I then used a feature selection method to retain the features that will contribute most towards modelling and prediction. After this I have used four classifiers namely,
* K- nearest neighbor
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Random Forestse 
I have modelled and predicted values using the training and testing sets respectively. The accuracy and confusion matrices were calculated. I also plotted the ROC curves for all the classifiers and came up with results performance wise.

## Problem Statement 2

In this notebook I have come up with visualizations related to the raw data. I have also given a brief analysis for each visualization. In the end I plotted a heatmap to show the correlations between the numerical variables.
